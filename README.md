E-commerce Product Page Challenge

Welcome to the E-commerce Product Page Challenge! In this project, I'm crafting a dynamic and visually appealing product page inspired by a designed Figma file. Leveraging my proficiency in JavaScript, I'm not just building a static page but pushing the boundaries by integrating advanced features.

Key Features:

1. Lightbox Product Gallery:
   Immerse yourself in a seamless product browsing experience with a sleek lightbox gallery. Effortlessly navigate through product images with a user-friendly interface.

2. Cart Functionality:
   Elevating user convenience, I'm implementing a robust cart functionality. Shoppers can easily add products to their cart, providing a frictionless e-commerce experience.

Technologies Utilized:

- JavaScript:
  My coding prowess takes center stage as I employ JavaScript to bring interactivity and dynamism to the product page. Expect smooth transitions and real-time updates.

- Responsive Design:
  Ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience across various devices, I've prioritized responsive design principles.

Why This Project?
This endeavor is not just about building a product page; it's a testament to my commitment to mastering the art of web development. By translating design concepts into a functional product page, I'm showcasing my ability to bridge the gap between creativity and technical implementation.

What Sets This Apart?

-Attention to Detail:
  Every pixel and interaction is meticulously crafted, staying true to the Figma design. The goal is to create a visually stunning and pixel-perfect product page.
